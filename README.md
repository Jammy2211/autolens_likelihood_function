PyAutoLens Likelihood Function
==============================

The ``autolens_workspace`` contains Jupyter notebooks describing the (log) likelihood functions used by **PyAutoLens**.

The notebooks provide a step-by-step guide of how **PyAutoLens** fits strong lens data, with the aim to make
the analysis clear to readers without background experience in strong lens modeling and make the modeling less 
of a "black box".

We recommend that when writing a paper using **PyAutoLens** the author links to this GitHub repository when describing 
their likelihood function. 

The notebooks are not stored here (they are on the ``autolens_workspace``), however URLs to every notebook are provided 
here. We recommend authors link to this GitHub repository (as opposed to direct links to each) because the 
URLs to notebooks on the ``autolens_workspace`` may change after papers are published. 

By linking to this repository a permenant URL is provided.

==============

There are different ways a strong lens can be modeled in **PyAutoLens**, we provide links describing the likelihood
function of all approaches below:
