PyAutoLens Likelihood Function
==============================

Accompanying **PyAutoLens** in the autolens workspace are Jupyter notebooks describing the (log) likelihood function
used to model strong lenses.

These notebooks provide a step-by-step guide for how **PyAutoLens** fits strong lens data, with the aim to make
the analysis clear to readers without background experience in strong lens modeling and make the strong lens modeling 
less of a "black box".

We recommend that authors using **PyAutoLens** refer to this GitHub repository when describing their likelihood
function. The notebooks are not stored here (they are on the autolens workspace), however URLs to every notebook
is provided here. 

The reason we use this GitHub repository (as opposed to direct links to each) is because the URLs may change after
papers are published. By linking to this repository a permenant URL is provided.

There are different ways a strong lens can be modeled in **PyAutoLens**, we provide links describing the likelihood
function of all approaches below:
